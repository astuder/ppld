WHAT IS PPLDEBUG GOOD FOR ?

uuuh, dunno .. my ego ?


     -----------------------------------------------------------


BUT HOW TO USE IT ?

pplDebug is a program that runs in the background and can be launched
by  a PPE.  For debugging a PPE it needs  the decompiled  source in a
special  form,  called symbolic-file.  This file can be  created with
PPLD  using the /SYMBOLIC switch.  Using the supplied DEBUG.PPE,  you
don't really have to care about this. Here a short instruction:

1) add the DEBUG.PPE to your CMD.LST (we suggest the command DEBUG)

2) put PPLD.EXE somewhere in the path

3) start PPLDEBUG.EXE
   it'll stay resident and needs about 4k of memory

4) start PCBoard and type DEBUG

5) you'll now be prompted for path and name of your favourite PPE
   you may also take a PPE from CMD.LST by typing its magic
   type ENTER at the empty line to quit

6) next question is path and name of the symbolic file
   when entering * and ENTER, it will be created by PPLD
   type ENTER at the empty line to quit

if everything goes fine, your screen switches to 50 lines and you see
some source in the lower half.  Use cursor and page up/down to browse
through the source. With F7 one PPE statement is executed.  Using F12
you start and stop continuos execution.  For leaving the debugger you
have to press F12 and the terminate the PPE as usual.

some short remarks:

- you can't debug huge PPEs as PCBoard runs out of memory.
- take care your users can't access DEBUG.PPE, your bbs may hang.
- launching PPEs with parameters may be tricky.
  decompile DEBUG.PPE and see how to launch the debugger from  within
  your favourite PPE.
