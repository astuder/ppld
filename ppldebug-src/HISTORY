History file, PPLdebug

[Here is a big part missing due to pink skunks in the morning. Ask Chicken   ]
[Internal Use only]

v1.00b		First release, trace (F7) and animate. Neat to explain what
		a debugger is, no working tool. Certainly kept people waiting
		for more.

v1.01		+ Second time start removes it from memory. (completely)
		+ screen resetted on exit of debugging                
		+ No Recursion anymore (didn't work anyway ;)         
		+ int 9 replacement. switches trace on f12 off.       
		+ Home and End handlers. Guess what.                  
		* all in all a nicer keyb handling. For a longer life.
		+ F8.. Step over. 02,17 09.07.1996 
		* bugfix step over. Even if there is a goto in a line with
		  other procedures being run, it manages to step over. 
		  (Waits on change in line number of SYM..)
	        + Left-right scrolling. Simple: Procedure outputstring has
	          one more parameter which indicates the horizontal 
	          displacement. Check this one out. Also check out left&right
	          with CTRL     	
                + Line number indicator. Totally useless but neat. fukkin hex
                + F4 here. Sets the same kind of breakpoint as f8 does, no
                  real bpoints yet.
                * the combined f12 is changed into f9 (run) and ctrl+f12
                  (break). The handling of breaks is neater.
		* f8/f4 routines faster. (search_valid.)
		* bugfix with procedure detect in f8. It doesn't anymore ;)
                  (beautiful secretaries can't type. Or whatever. ;)

v1.10b		* New Module, Break.asm. Handles Breakpoints.
		+ Finally the Breakpoints. F2, static list, simple like hell.
 	 	+ ALT X handling. 
		* CTRL f12 becomes CTRL Break. Easier to remember.
                * fixed a real nasty one: F8 fucked screen (CLS didn't work
 	          proper anymore. turned out to be a good old typo. Made some 
                  major changes in proc maindebug. (ds -> cs)
	        + NEW NEW NEW Symbolic File. Revision 1, Variables & Functions
                * bugfuck: Errors while loading run flawless..
		  check out the new error handling. Almost User friendly.
		+ Double <'s on each side indicating there's more text there.
		  (Had to create ClearEol for that)
v1.3b
		* Adding the Variable handling. (as in ppevar.doc)
16,49 21.11.1996                   (works rudimentary.. ;)
