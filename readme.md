# PPLD - PCBoard PPE Decompiler

This is as a project of mine from back in 1994-1996. 
It was developed with a DOS version of Borland C (Turbo C?), and I don't know whether it still compiles.

Released to the public domain for your entertainment. Warranty void.

## What does PPLD do?

Back in the heyday of dial-up BBS, [PCBoard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCBoard) was one of the leading 
applications to run them. To add custom functionality, PCBoard came with its own programming language (PPL) and a
compiler (PPLC) that turned the code into an executable module (PPE). PPLD is a decompiler that converts compiled
PPEs back into source code.

## History

I built the first version of PPLD in 1994 when asked by a friend to check if a given PPE has a backdoor. When PPLD
was originally released, backdoors were discoverd in quite a few popular PPEs. 

The source code generated by PPLD can be compiled by PPLC, which allowed modification of 3rd part PPEs. As with all
reverse engineering this feature was used for the good (adding functionality and fixing bugs) and the bad (removing
licensing restrictions, distributing copies with added backdoors), 

## Why put it on GitHub now?

I recently did major rework on the 8051 disassembler for the [radare2](https://radare.org) project, which reminded me
of this reverse engineering project of mine from over 20 years ago. Excuse some of the language in the readme files,
I was young, brash and in questionable control of the English language. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
