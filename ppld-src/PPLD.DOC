                   (C)1994-97 Chicken [Tools4Fools]

                          This is No-Ware
                       Get lost to register !

WHAT IS PPLD GOOD FOR ?

Makes your potatoes grow BIGGER !
Gives you a body IRRESTIBLE to ANY kind of girls !
Cures your aunts gout, hunchback AND PERITONITIS !
Makes your wedding dress DAZZLING white !
Brings you BILLIONS of dollars ! (send me $186.43 for more details)
Kills ANYTHING with more than four legs tickling in your hair !

Ah  yeah, and besides this, it  decompiles  the  PCBoard  Programming
Language Executables (.PPE) back  to  what they were  before  the so-
called compilation. Well, they call it compilation, in fact it's just
a translation  to tockens simple  enough to be executed by the stupid
interpreter (my C-64 did it too).

[philosophical intermezzo ON]

  As long as Clark Development Company Inc. can't come up with a REAL
  compiler there will be decompilers by me or  by others. CDC started
  to  encrypt the .PPEs created  with  PPLC 3.0 and  newer.  The only
  effect is even more slowness, nothing else.  Ah yes, it also  makes
  it harder for talented coders to protect their work  with some well
  misplaced bytes (Anti Decompiling System). Dear CDC developers, why
  not creating some real ASM code ?  PPEs would run at a decent speed
  and decompilers would be dead forever.  Right, real compilers are a
  bit trickier to do.  But hey !  What are you getting your bucks for
  then ?

  Thank you.

     -----------------------------------------------------------


BUT HOW TO USE IT ?

ppld [options] srcname[.ext] [dstname[.ext]]

Standard  extensions are:  for source .PPE,  for destination .PPD (to
prevent overwriting of existing source code).

Options:

/NOTRACE  - Disable Trace Mode
            PPLD will decompile the whole code and therefore probably
            get traped by an  anti decompiling  trick. But if it gets
            through, you can seek for disabled features  and mindless
            coders.

/SYMBOLIC - Create Symbolic File
            PPLD will add debugging  information to  the source. This
            .SYM file is required to trace a PPE with PPLDebug. Check
            out the PPLDebug docs.


     -----------------------------------------------------------


TROUBLE SHOOTINGS (BLAM BLAM, YOU'RE DEAD)

PPLC replaces all FOR/WHILE/CASE/... thingies with IF/GOTO statements
and rearranges  IF [..] THEN [..] ENDIF like this (with ELSE it  gets
even worse):

        IF [..] THEN
        [..]
        ENDIF           ..is compiled as:

        IF ![..] GOTO LABEL
        [..]
        :LABEL

Little hint: As the  usage of FOR [...] NEXT causes a real mess  with
lotta useless worstcase bound checkings, your program will run faster
when  you  implement the routine  using WHILE or an  own IF [..] THEN
construction.

Serious crashes can be caused by the following reasons:

     a) A REAL big .PPE needs too many labels.
        "can't imagine"

     b) A REAL nasty line gets too long.
        "we think our .ppe isn't slow enough"
        (seems to get common to make 1000 times 1+1, but let me warn
         you that this costs you several kbytes of stack and makes
         your .ppe running sloooooooooow)

     c) A REAL ugly expression needs too much iterations.
        "recursion rulez"

     d) I created buggy translation tables.
        "beautiful secretaries can't type"

It is possible that a .PPE doesn't recompile to the same size for the
following reasons:

     a) PPLD will skip unused code.  (Use the /NOTRACE option to dis-
        able this feature)
        "this one is called *AI Optimation Mode*"

     b) PPLD just forgets about variables defined but not used in the
        code. (variables are recognized upon usage at positions where
        PPLC requires VAR as function/statement parameter)
        "this one is called *AI Optimation Mode* too"

     c) You have to  compile with the same commandline options as the
        author used for the original .PPE.
        "my two-lines-ppe takes only one kilobyte"

     d) There are some quite strange .PPEs with only half of the pre-
        defined user variables included.
        "public betas suck"

     e) There's a bug in PPLC. You'll get a note in the .PPD if this
        bug was used to protect the .PPE from decompiling.

It is possible that a .PPE doesn't recompile at all for the following
reasons:

     a) With some tricks, it's possible to use the  ENDPROC / ENDFUNC
        statements before the real end of a procedure/function.

        Example: IF condition THEN
                    ENDPROC             ;the early end
                 ENDIF
                 [...]
                 ENDPROC                ;the real end

                 This code will decompile to something like:

                 IF !condition GOTO label
                 ENDPROC                ;the early end
                 :label
                 [...]
                 ENDPROC                ;the real end

        The problem with this is, that PPLC refuses to recompile this
        code  as  it refuses  to know  the label  behind the  ENDPROC
        statement.  To make it working again,  just retype it  in the
        original IF .. THEN .. ENDIF style.  Hope to fix this in next
        century.

At the end of  the source, is a list of used functions/statements. If
you encounter some missing names or ???s the command is unknown.

                - bugfix: added missing statement FREALTUSER
                - bugfix: added missing function HIMSGNUM
                - bugfix: added missing function LOMSGNUM
                - bugfix: added missing function KBDFILUSED
                - bugfix: added missing function PPLBUFSIZE
                - bugfix: added missing function KBDBUFSIZE
                - bugfix: added missing function FLAGCNT

20.08.94        release of version 1.02 (it's alive!)
                * recursive trace mode to detect decompiling traps.
                  This  prevents PPLD  from decompiling passages with
                  unknown functions/statements.
                  As side effect it won't decompile unused code.
                * added /NOTRACE option to turn off trace mode and
                  its "features".
                - bugfix: decompilation errors on VARSEG, VAROFFS,
                  VARADDR, SCRFILE after SORT-bugfix in last version

22.09.94        release of version 2.00 (the fake!)
                !!!!!!!! DON'T USE IT, IT'S A TROYAN !!!!!!!!

13.10.95        release of version 3.00 (who says late?)
                * added PPLC 3.0 decryption
                * added PPLC 3.0 new statements/functions/types...
                * added PPLC 3+ procedures/functions
                * added PPLC 3.10 decryption (which doesn't pack 0's
                  if there's no gain in it)
                * added PPLC 3.10 new statements/functions
                * added PPLC 3.20 new statements/functions
                * added !0+!0 bug detection
                - bugfix: decrypting aborted even everything was ok
                - bugfix: trace aborted on jump to program start/end
                - bugfix: 4 times more memory for BIIIIIIIG strings
                - bugfix: correct output of floatingpoint constants
                  ARGH! costs 10kb of executable size!!!
                  (hmm, wonder why you didn't notice this ? are PPE
                  coders too stupid to use 'em ?)

16.05.96        release of version 3.10 (a new dimension)
                * added /SYMBOLIC option to create symbolic files for
                  PPLDebug, see also PPLDEBUG.DOC
                * added simple-WHILE analyzing so recompiled ppe will
                  work now, eg: WHILE (var="") var=INKEY()
                  (HEY! this was THAT obvious and not a single bug
                   report reached me !?)
                + updated PPLC bug-info
                - bugfix: mixed up labels in ppe with more than 32k
                  bytes of code
                - bugfix: trace aborted on WHILE statement
                - bugfix: correct handling of INT, SBYTE, SWORD etc.
                  constants (used by Acidic to fuckup PPLD, bad boys)
                - bugfix: now correctly counts lines with PPLC bugs

13.03.97        release of version 3.20 (nothing new)
                + new symbolic file format for PPLDebug 1.1b
                - saved 2kb of size, is there something missing ?

The version  with Clark Development copyrights is a fake/ripoff/patch
of PPLD version 1.00 by unknown losers (same code, same bugs).

The version 2.00  released by an unknown  lamer in september '94 is a
troyan and will most probably delete your harddisk.
