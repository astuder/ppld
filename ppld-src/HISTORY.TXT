History:
--------

1.00á   26.05.94  first working version

1.00á2  27.05.94  this version will decompile 99% (last was about 80%)
                  * bracktes striping algorythm (c) by me
                  * output predefined variables/constants with name
                  + way faster label processing
                  + nicer text output
                  - bugfix crash on STARTDISP
                  - bugfix for strings including quotes (").

1.00á3  27.05.94  uuuuh, lotta bugs, hope this one will work out 99%
                  - bugfix crash on BEEP (undocumented statement)
                  - bugfix crash on FWRITE/FDWRITE (bug in PPLC docs)
                  - bugfix crash on STOP
                  - bugfix output of labels after last statement

1.00á4  30.05.94  * output of memory informations
                  * save exit at unknown functions/statements
                  - bugfix OUT OF MEMORY (at least 20k more memory)

1.00á5  31.05.94  + some cosmetics on c code
                  + now uses all available memory
                  - bugfix memory output is no longer signed
                  - bugfix misstyped function MASK_NUM
                  - bugfix misstyped statement FPUTPAD

1.00á6  09.06.94  * added destination to commandline
                    '>' is no longer needed
                  * extension and destination guessing at commandline
                    now PPLD MYPPE will decompile MYPPE.PPE to MYPPE.PPS
                    (let me know if you prefer the extension .PPD)
                  * 'PPLC-like' screen output
                  + heavy cosmetics on c code (expect some new bugs)
                  + improved string-stack (argl, took me 3 hours)
                    now an expression can take up to 4000 characters and
                    expressions can be as complex as 4000 chars allow
                  - removed (useless) memory informations

1.00á7  11.06.94  + changed default destination extension to .PPD
                  + limited .ppe format information in source
                  + output fixed for final release version
